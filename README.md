Gabon County populations represented with color gradients [here](https://rpubs.com/mabuch/653485)

# Gabon Spatial Data Description
Gabon counties with population data represented with a [bar plot and map](https://rpubs.com/mabuch/656240)
    My published html will not include text. While im working on a fix here are the descriptions I wrote for each visual:
        This first image represents all of Gabon, and displays the population density for each of its counties through a gradient color scheme. To the right of the map, I displayed the same data for each county in a bar plot organized by size.
        This image zooms into a chosen county within Gabon: Wouleu-Ntem. The same methods are used to display population density in each of this counties' subdivisions.
